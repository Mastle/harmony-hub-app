/* 

    current step(short overview):
      - creating app routes and navigation links with react router
        -- Time to create a legit homepage, and then separate the Authlayout
        -- so it looks like the homepage is gonna need a navbar (skipping footer 'cause I'm too busy with other stuff for now)
        --> what is "outlet" in react router?
        -- need to set up the routes for virtual piano and music player properly
      - implement the piano fully
      - move on to music player and real time note highlighting
      - add as much as feature as you can till the end of ESFAND
      - Joyful Speaking is next
