    current step(short overview): 
    (TODO is reserved for issues)
      - creating app routes and navigation links with react router
        -->  create the authentication layout and implement auth system properly
        -- The navbar has to change "login" to "Profile"
        -- Make the menu responsive
        -- The "Dashboard" page is what the users will see which consists of two cards: "instruments" card and the "music player" card
        -- need to set up the routes for virtual piano and music player properly
      - implement the piano fully
      - move on to music player and real time note highlighting
      - add as much as feature as you can till the end of ESFAND
      - Joyful Speaking is next
