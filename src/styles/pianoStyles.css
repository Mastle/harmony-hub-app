     current step(short overview): 
       -> - Adding the Piano
          -- The react code has been added, but it needs to be polished and optimized. Start with reading and understanding the code as best as you can 
          -- In order to understand this right, I must thoroughlly study the vanilla piano first
          -- finished studying the vanilla piano
          -- need to add some styles before I can study the react version
        not sure when the next instruments will be added, there's a bunch of cool new features that might be more valuable than another instrument for this app
       - move on to music player and real time note highlighting
       - Joyful Speaking is next
